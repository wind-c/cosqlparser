	// INVALID_ARGUMENT indicates client specified an invalid argument.

	// DEADLINE_EXCEEDED means operation expired before completion.
	// For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be

	// PERMISSION_DENIED indicates the caller does not have permission to
	// execute the specified operation. It must not be used for rejections
	// caused by exhausting some resource (use RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
	// instead for those errors).  It must not be
	// used if the caller cannot be identified (use Unauthenticated
	// instead for those errors).

	Code_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED int32 = 8
	// FAILED_PRECONDITION indicates operation was rejected because the
	// system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.
	// For example, directory to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir
	// operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
	//
	// A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
	// between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
	//  (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
	//  (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level
	//      (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
	//  (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
	//      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
	//      fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
	//      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
	//      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
	//  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
	//      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
	//      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
	//      read-modify-write on the same resource.
	Code_FAILED_PRECONDITION int32 = 9
	// ABORTED indicates the operation was aborted, typically due to a
	// concurrency issue like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts,
	// etc.

	// ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.
	Code_ABORTED int32 = 10
	// OUT_OF_RANGE means operation was attempted past the valid range.
	// E.g., seeking or reading past end of file.
	//
	// Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may
	// be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
	// system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an
	// offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
	// OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current
	// file size.
	//
	// There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
	// OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific
	// error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
	// a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when
	// they are done.
